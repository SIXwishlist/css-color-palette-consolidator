CSS Color Palette Consolidator
---------------------------

Work in Progress. The goal is to extract colors used in your CSS, show you the color palette visually, and give you an easy way to consolidate colors! With growing codebases, we often end up with tons of CSS colors and manually finding/replacing is no fun, so this tool aims to make life easy. :)
